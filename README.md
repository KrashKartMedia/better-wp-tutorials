Creates short codes for user interactive tutorials. If a user is logged in, outputs pretty links, linking the user to their site defined in the WordPress Profile form. If user is passing by, output ugly text and convince them to become a free member.

== Description ==

WordPress tutorials help millions of users add functionality to their WordPress websites. The problem with tutorials starts with daisy chanes of instructions or really long urls to copy. 

Interactive Tutorials is a simple WordPress plugin allowing users to define their website address in the standard WordPress user profile and uses that link the the shortcode, to link users to a page on their site. 

Say a users site is https:russellenvy.com. The user creates a free account on your site and pastes the url in their profile. You create a shortcode linking to the permalinks page inside the users dashbaord. 

Instead of telling the user: Log into your site > visit the dashboard > Settings > Permalinks

You can use a shortcode to link a user to https://russellenvy.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php. Instead of showing the full link, you can replace the text with <a href="https://russellenvy.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php">View Permalinks</a>" Plugin and theme urls, inside of the WordPress Dashboard, hardly change. Let's take advantage of this.
